        We ask for certain information such as your username, birthday, email address,
        timezone, password, geolocation (longitude and latitude) when you sign up to Pearscom
        or if you correspond with us. We may collect data about your interests through your
        friends which we use in order to provide the best and most interesting content for you.
        Every information (exept your log in email address and password) you give and release
        will be published on Pearscom.
      </p>
      <i>Inviting a friend to use Pearscom</i>
      <p>

        understood that we may store and your friends' email addresses but we do not publish
        it. You understand that you send invitation emails to your friends into their inbox.

        this communication.
      </p>
      <i>Finding your friends on Pearscom</i>
      <p>
        Pearscom may develop a feature for finding your friends on the service by providing a
        "direct search" for your friends in the case if the user is signed up to Pearscom and
        activated their account. We may give you friend suggestions which is uncontrollabe by
        the users. This is an automated system giving friend suggestions for users by comparing
        their geolocation, age, city and distance from each other. We may list your friends of
        friends or people who may like. You understand that you only request as friend those
        users who you really know. We cannot control the users' behaviour about adding
        strangers as friends or block other people.
      </p>

        services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools
        collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you
        visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and
